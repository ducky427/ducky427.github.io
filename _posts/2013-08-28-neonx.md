I was playing around with [NetworkX](http://networkx.github.io/), an excellent
graph library for python. I wanted to upload the data I created to [Neo4j](http://www.neo4j.org/).
But I couldn't find an easy way of doing this. So I created a library to move a NetworkX graph to Neo4j through two methods:

*  Convert a networkx graph to [Geoff](http://www.neo4j.org/develop/python/geoff) compatible string which could then be uploaded through a varity of ways.

* Directly upload the graph using the [Neo4j Batch REST API](http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/rest-api-batch-ops.html)


To install:
{% highlight bash %}
pip install neonx
{% endhighlight %}

To upload a graph to neo4j

{% highlight python %}
import networkx as nx

import neonx

graph = nx.balanced_tree(2, 1, create_using=nx.DiGraph())
result = neonx.write_to_neo("http://localhost:7474/db/data/", graph, "LINKS_TO")

{% endhighlight %}

I am assuming that all the properties of the nodes and edges are json encodeable.
If not, you can easily pass a json encoder object to handle custom data types as mentioned [here](http://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html#json.JSONDecoder). Example [here](http://neonx.readthedocs.org/en/latest/usage.html).
