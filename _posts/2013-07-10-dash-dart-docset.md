I have been using [Dash](http://kapeli.com/) as a documentation browser. Its really handy when I am offline. I've created a docset for [dart](http://www.dartlang.org/) and put it put on github [here](https://github.com/ducky427/dartdash).

It has also a docset feed [here](dash-feed://http%3A%2F%2Fducky427.github.io%2Fdart.xml).

Contributions welcome.
